# VibratingFlashlight
Make your iDevice vibrate when turning the flashlight on, off, or vibrate constantly while adjusting the strength of the flashlight from the expanded Control Center module. A very simple tweak meant to teach aspiring developers how to use haptic feedback.

This tweak is meant to teach how to use Haptic, NOT for people to copy the tweak. Please don't steal code. I've held back open sourcing my best work, and stopped updating FolderControllerXII due to the high number of "developers" copy pasting features from my repos and releasing them as their own tweaks.
